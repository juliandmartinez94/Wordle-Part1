# Project 1 - Wordle Part 1

Wordle is an app where the user guesses a five letter word. After each try, the app will display the letters in different colors: 
green if the letter is in the correct spot
yellow if the letter exists in the word, but is in the incorrect placement

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app: 

- I am used to programming in java and I'm getting used to the Swift syntax whcih has taken some time.
  Also, XCode is a great resource, but I still have very limited knowledge on some of the features and shortcuts.
